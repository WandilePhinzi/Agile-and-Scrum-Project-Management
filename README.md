# Project Overview:
This repository contains information about the Agile and Scrum Project Management. As well as the planning and deadlines of each of the five projects to be completed this semester. It also includes resources for the CMPG 323 module

## Project Structure:
In the Agile and Scrum Project Management repository.A github Kanban project is setup to keep track of the current work for all 5 projects throughout the semester effectively.
For API Development project. A repository API Development will be created and will be used to complete Project 2.  Which requires the implementation of CRUD RESTful that connects to a database storing basic telemetry data
A repository will be created for Blazor Application Development project named Blazor Application Development repository. This project will include an existing Blazor Application which needs to be enhanced and improved that manages project and client data with CRUD functionalities as part of project 3.
For UIPath Test Automation project, a new repository will be created namly UIPath Test Automation repository to manage the UiPath project effectively.
For Reporting project , a Power BI repository will be created to keep track of the powerBI report and data models

## Development Methodolodies to be used:
- API Development: C#
- Blazor Application Development: C#
- UIPath Test Automation: UiPath
- Reporting: PowerBI

## Importance of gitignore in each project:
A git.ignore for project 1 would be useful to keep the repository clean as it reduces the risk of merge conflicts by ignoring unnecessary files and also improves collaboration.
A git.ignore is useful for project 2 to prevent sensitive NWU Tech Trends information leaks.
Project 3,4 and 5 also deals with clients data which is sensitive information.A git.ignpre file would be essential in handling sensitive information and help prevent accidental exposure
For project 1. A trunk based development strategy will be used since project 1 primarily focusses on planning , documentation and requirements analysis rather than coding.
For project 2 a feature based branching strategy will be used to fix occuring errors in a separate branch
Since i will be working on an existing Blazor application, a feature- based  branching strategy would  be useful to isolate new features and refactor changes without affecting the main code
A feature base branching strategy will also be used for project 4 and 5.

## Security concerns and Best Practices:
The storage of credentials and sensitive information is a crucial part of this project. Improper storage can lead to data breaches and compromise valuable information
It is important to protect credentials and sensitive information, this can be done by using storage methods such as encryoted configuration files, secure storage systems and password managers
